# SportsAnalysis
This is Jay Xiao , Kamila Wong, and Taylor Rohovit's Sports Analysis Project

Focus: Optimizing the scheduling of WTA professional tennis players

Methods: Python, Scikit, Linear Optimization

You should be able to run this code by following this codepath and running the file: sports-analysis/website/src/backend/modelBACKENDTESING.py
Since we haven't finished deployment of the website yet, this is simply the backend of the model.
Notes about running: we don't error check in backend, since the frontend testing holds the error checking portion. So when running, please follow the instructions about what values to enter.
The libraries that we rely on are mainly PuLP, pandas, and scikit.
