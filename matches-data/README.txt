This folder contains all of the data that we gathered from the Jeff Sackman Github.
The data from this folder trains the linear regression models that we use.
The raw data is the csv's with dates, while the cleaned data has the level of the tournament (Challengers, Internation, ITF, etc.).
The .py files are all functions that we used to process the data
